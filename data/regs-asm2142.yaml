            Set this bit to divide the CPU clock frequency by two. This affects
            both the CPU and the timer peripheral, as the timer clock is derived
            from the CPU clock. Set this bit to set the CPU clock to 78.125 MHz
            and the timer clock to approximately 9.537 kHz. Clear this bit to
            use the undivided CPU clock speed of 156.25 MHz and timer clock
            speed of approximately 19.073 kHz.
      notes: |
        The settings in this register will take effect and be latched into
        `CPU_MODE_CURRENT` at the next reset.

            This bit is set if the current code is executing from CODE RAM,
            and it's clear if executing from CODE ROM. This bit will always be
            set when our code is running, since our code is always loaded from
            flash into CODE RAM by the CODE ROM.

            If set, this bit indicates that the CPU clock is being divided by
            two. If it's clear, the CPU clock is not being divided by two. See
            `CPU_MODE_NEXT.CLOCK_DIV` for more information.
      notes: |
        The value of this register is latched from `CPU_MODE_NEXT` on reset,
        and indicates the settings for the currently-executing code.

            Set this bit to halt the CPU. Doing this is not advised, since
            there is no way to recover from this halted state except by
            removing and re-applying power.
